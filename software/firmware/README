Firmware to run on the external nodes, interfacing a RFID-RC522 type reader
providing a serial interface on the other side.

Initial implementation directly reads the RFID and unlocks the door (until there
is the hardware infrastructure to connect the cables)

To compile, you need the avr toolchain installed
  sudo aptitude install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude
