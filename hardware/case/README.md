The case for the RFID reader.
=============================

   - Mounting holes for the wall on the base-plate, invisible from top.
   - Cleat system allows for single-screw fixing of outer shell to wall.
   - Cabeling behind the board
   - Noisebridge Logo lends itself to a nice RFID-logo modification :)

This 'xray' view reveals the french cleat system to hold the top case in place.
The mounting screw on the bottom pulls down the inner assembly thus pulls it
towards the wall. Removing that screw allows to remove the case easily to the
top:
