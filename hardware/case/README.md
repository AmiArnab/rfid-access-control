The case for the RFID reader.

TODO: someone knowledeable with inkscape please make the "RFID-waves" not
a single trace with a thickness, but rather a filled shape - so thin trace, but
filled 'arc volume. ... otherwise the DXF export just generates an infinite small
line...

The STL file is generated from the *.scad file using the Makefile. Just
included for github display purposes :)
