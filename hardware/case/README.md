The case for the RFID reader.
=============================

   - Mounting holes for the wall on the base-plate, invisible from top.
   - Cleat system allows for single-screw fixing of outer shell to wall.
   - Cabeling behind the board
   - Noisebridge Logo lends itself to a nice RFID-logo modification :)
